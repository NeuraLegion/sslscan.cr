  # there is some issue in Spectator v0.9.36+. I wasn't able to identify the root,
  # but for some strange reason it crashes during the call of Log.info or Log.error
  # in Parser::parse? and Report::initialize. Replacing this calls to Log.debug
  # fixing the issue, but it is incorrect. So for the current moment it is better
  # to lock the version of Spectator.
